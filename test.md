# Example Markdown File

This is the first paragraph of our example markdown file. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It was created by John Gruber in 2004.

```toc
from: 1
to: 2
```

## Here's an h2

Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or \*. For example, you can use one asterisk or underscore to create _italic_ text, or use two for **bold** text. To create headers, you can use the hash symbol followed by a space and the text for your header. It's as simple as that!
