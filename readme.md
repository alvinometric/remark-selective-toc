# remark-selective-toc

A remark plugin to selectively add a table of contents and configure it for each markdown file. Ported and updated from [`gatsby-remark-table-of-contents`](https://github.com/signalwerk/gatsby-remark-table-of-contents).

````markdown
# ðŸ‘‡ This code block gets replaced with a TOC of h2 headings only

```toc
from: 1
to: 2
```
````

## Installation

```bash
npm install remark-selective-toc
```

## When should I use this?

- You need more specific control over the TOC, such as excluding certain heading levels.
- You're working with multiple markdown files that each require different TOC configurations
- Some of your markdown files don't warrant a TOC at all.

## Options

### `from`

- Type: `number`
- Default: `2`

Sets the minimum heading depth to include.

### `to`

- Type: `number`
- Default: `6`

Sets the maximum heading depth to include.

### `className`

- Type: `string`
- Default: `toc`

Sets the class name of the div wrapping your table of contents.

### `tight`

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`

`tight` lets you specify whether or not you want spaces before and between the list items.

```markdown
<!-- tight: true -->

- [Here's an h2](#heres-an-h2)

- [Another h2](#another-h2)

  - [and H3](#and-h3)

<!-- tight: false -->

- [Here's an h2](#heres-an-h2)
- [Another h2](#another-h2)
  - [and H3](#and-h3)
```

### `exclude`

- Type: `string` or `array`
- Default: `''`

Excludes titles matching this regex pattern.

### `ordered`

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`

Chooses between ordered and unordered list.

## Differences with `gatsby-remark-table-of-contents`

`tight` is true by default.
